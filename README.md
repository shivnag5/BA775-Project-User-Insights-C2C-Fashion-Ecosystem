# BA775-Project-User-Insights-C2C-Fashion-Ecosystem
This was a group project conducted during my time at Boston University in the M.S. Business Analytics Program; It is a SQL-based analysis of the C2C retail ecosystem globally from 2020 to 2024 and aims to Identify demographic, geographic, and social trends to uncover growth opportunities and provide recommendations for improved user experience.

## Business Problem Definition
C2C, also known as consumer to consumer, is an emerging market for retail shoppers where consumers sell directly to one another usually through an intermediary platform. Though it is increasing in popularity, the market capacity of C2C is still less than traditional B2C retailers (Business to consumer). On the dataset, there is an increase in the ID Hash of new users registering to be consumers or suppliers on the C2C platforms. If the team identifies demographics and customer groups that are underserved in the C2C space, the team can make recommendations on how businesses can change their engagement efforts, offerings, and targeted incentives to improve a good user experience for the consumers. This approach can help convert potential buyers, driving sales and strengthening the platform’s customer base, and ultimately boost overall profitability and create a stronger customer base.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project stems from the company’s vision to lead the transformation of the C2C fashion market by empowering users and driving sustainable commerce. As a competitive platform, understanding user behavior is essential to foster meaningful engagement, improving user retention, and maximizing sales opportunities. With the increasing consumer demand for personalized experiences and eco-conscious choices, this project aims to position the platform as a trusted, innovative leader in the second-hand fashion space. By leveraging deeper data insights, the company can enhance customer satisfaction, refine its offerings, and expand its market reach, all while contributing to a more sustainable and connected fashion ecosystem.

## Dataset Description
The following website is where we were able to gather the customer and user information for the e-commerce company:

The following website is where we were able to gather the country codes:

These datasets contain a list of users identified by unique ID Hash for 2020 and 2024. The name of the original file for 2020 was “users.6M0xxK.2020.public.csv ” and for 2024 was “users.6M0xxK.2024.public.csv”. The original 2020 CSV file contains 24 columns with 98,913 rows, and the original 2024 CSV file contains 21 columns and a total of 20,743 rows. The following ERD shows the relationship between our different datasets as well as the specific columns that make up the data. The representation of the data that we have displayed below is created for the cleaned versions of the datasets described, so there may be some differences.

To begin, the goal is to utilize the datasets and conduct a year to year analysis to identify key trends in current user behavior (language, country, intent of joining platform, social media usage etc.) and compare it to new users who have joined to identify reasons for user retention and KPIs such as click-through rate.
